This project is a simple Python script that generates an image from a text prompt using the pre-trained Stable Diffusion v1-4 model by CompVis, via the  Hugging Face diffusers library.
Features
Uses the powerful Stable Diffusion model to create images from text.

Automatically detects GPU (CUDA) for faster generation.

Saves the output image as generated_image.png.
